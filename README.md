# user-interactive-3D-chess

this project 3D Rotating Chess Game Using Computer Graphics implements a classic two-player chess game with a graphical user interface using OpenGL, offering immersive 3D rendering and interactive rotations on an 8x8 checkered board.


 _**Introduction to Project:**_
 
The project ‘3D (playing & Rotating) CHESS GAME USING COMPUTER GRAPHICS’ implements a classic version of Chess with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. Our implementation of Chess is for two players (use of Artificial Intelligence). It is played on an 8x8 checked board, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner.

We successfully created a GUI using text-based version, inheritance and templates, as specified. Despite several unusual bugs in the GUI, our Chess program is a great, user- friendly game for two players.

**What a chess game Possess?**

Chess is a game played by 2 people on a chessboard with 16 pieces each. Our project implements the chess game with graphical user interface. The chess game follows the basic rules of chess and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. Our implementation of chess is for two players (no artificial intelligence). It is played on an 8*8 checkered board, with a dark square in each player’s lower left corner.

In the realm of Computer Graphics, the marriage of traditional games with modern visualisations offers a captivating journey into the realm of digital artistry and programming prowess. This project delves into the fusion of the timeless game of chess with the dynamic capabilities of OpenGL, a versatile graphics library. Through the utilisation of three-dimensional rendering and interactive rotations, this endeavour aims to present chess in a visually immersive and engaging manner.

The project explores the intersection of classic gameplay mechanics with cutting-edge graphical representation, providing users with an enhanced chess experience. Leveraging OpenGL's capabilities, players can navigate a virtual chessboard, observing the game from various angles and perspectives. This dynamic visualisation not only serves as a visual spectacle but also offers strategic insights by allowing players to analyse the board from different viewpoints.

By implementing real-time rendering and smooth rotations, the project aims to transcend the traditional two-dimensional constraints of chess, offering a fresh perspective to enthusiasts and novices alike. Through meticulous design and programming, this endeavour seeks to showcase the potential of computer graphics in augmenting traditional games, elevating both their aesthetic appeal and interactive depth. we unveil the mesmerising world of 3D Rotating Chess—a testament to the symbiotic relationship between art, technology, and timeless gameplay.

This project implements a classic version of Chess using Java and a Graphical User Interface. The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. Our implementation of Chess is for two players. It is played on an 8x8 checkered board, with a dark square in each player’s lower left corner.

 **Goals of our Project:**
 
First goal is to allow two users or players to play the game interactively from remote locations.
The second goal will be that the program should be working and allow the users to play the game.

What our chess game can do?

● IMPROVES PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES.

● IMPROVE LOGIC AND REASONING SKILLS.

● INCREASE PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE.

● IMPROVES DECISION-MAKING SKILLS.

**Requirement Specification:**

 **Conclusion:**
 
In this project “DESIGNING OF CHESS GAME USING COMPUTER GRAPHICS” we presented the classic and standard version of Chess implemented as a GUI. We successfully created a game using inheritance, templates, Artificial Intelligence and a OpenGL Library. The project had two aims, all of them which were achieved. The aims of the project were important as they identified what the project was trying to achieve. Their aims were:

● 
First aim is to allow two users or players to play the game interactively from remote locations.

●
The second aim is that the java program for the chess game should be working properly and allow the users to play the game.

The planning for the project was very well carried out as it initially had two weeks of slack available. This allowed for leniency if any task took longer than anticipated. All asks were completed in the order they were anticipated.

In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a 3D chess game using OpenGL graphics. Through a combination of user-defined functions, OpenGL libraries, and game logic, the program creates an interactive and visually appealing chess experience.

Through the integration of OpenGL graphics and user interface design, the project achieves its objective of creating an engaging and immersive chess game environment. By leveraging OpenGL's capabilities for rendering 3D graphics and handling user input, the project showcases the versatility and power of OpenGL in game development.

Rendering a 3D chessboard with alternating dark and light squares.

Representing chess pieces as 3D models on the board.

Allowing players to interact with the game through keyboard inputs, including selecting pieces, moving them, and navigating the board.
Implementing standard chess rules for piece movement, capturing, and special moves like castling and pawn promotion.

Providing visual feedback through highlighted valid moves, check, and checkmate notifications. Enabling game restart and exit functionality for a seamless user experience.
project serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the realm of 3D chess games.
